# Random Fact Generator
Fetch a random, useless fact. This was made using Tailwind CSS and jQuery. This was my first project using these two libraries! It was also my first project using json data. Anyways, view the website at [https://pizzalover125.github.io/randomFactGenerator/](https://pizzalover125.github.io/randomFactGenerator/).
